# CodeAlpha_HangmanGame

Welcome to my implementation of the classic **Hangman Game** – created as **Task 1** of my internship at **CodeAlpha**. This project is a great starting point for beginners looking to apply core Python concepts in a fun and interactive way.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a **text-based game** where the player must guess a hidden word, one letter at a time. With each wrong guess, the number of remaining attempts decreases. The player wins by guessing all letters correctly before reaching the maximum number of wrong guesses.

---

## ✅ Features

- Random word selection from a predefined list
- Input validation (single letters only, no repeats)
- Keeps track of correct and incorrect guesses
- Ends the game after 6 wrong attempts
- Console-friendly and beginner-readable code
- Fun and functional user feedback (✅ / ❌)

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

This project reinforces essential Python fundamentals:

- `random.choice()` for word selection  
- `while` loops for game logic  
- `if-else` statements for decision-making  
- `lists` and `strings` for tracking progress  
- `input()` and string methods for user interaction

## 💻 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Clone this repository or download the `.py` file.
3. Run the script in your terminal or code editor:

```bash
python hangman.py
